## Features

- Provides autocomplete suggestions in a popup menu when user input LaTex math formula.
- Provides a general rule format to customize the autocomplete behavior so that users can add arbitrary autocomplete rules and modify built-in rules, not just mathematical formulas.
- Do a variety of mathematical operations directly in rems.

## How to Use

- The default hotkeys are:
  - `down`: select the next suggestion.
  - `up`: select the previous suggestion.
  - `tab`: insert the currently selected suggestion into the editor.
- You can customise the hotkeys in the settings.
  - Note that hotkeys for this plugin must be specified as text in the settings - eg. `ctrl+n` or `enter` rather than using the normal hotkey system in RemNote.

- Type `/playmath` and confirm, it'll automatically create code block and add playmath powerup to the block. 
  You can enter various mathematical operations and automatically display their results. 
  You can check [mathnotepad](https://mathnotepad.com/) to learn how to use it by example. We all use mathjs to achieve this feature.
