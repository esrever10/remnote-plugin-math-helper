## How to Use

- The default hotkeys are:
  - `down`: select the next suggestion.
  - `up`: select the previous suggestion.
  - `enter`: insert the currently selected suggestion into the editor.
- You can customise the hotkeys in the settings.
  - Note that hotkeys for this plugin must be specified as text in the settings - eg. `ctrl+n` or `tab` rather than using the normal hotkey system in RemNote.

- Type `/playmath` and confirm, it'll automatically create add playmath powerup to the block. 
  Then 
  You can enter various mathematical operations and automatically display their results. 
  You can check [mathnotepad](https://mathnotepad.com/) to learn how to use it by example. We all use mathjs to achieve this feature.
